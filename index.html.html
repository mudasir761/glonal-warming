          <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a gradual warming effect. This process contributes to climate change, resulting in more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, and disruptions to ecosystems. The primary sources of these emissions include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.
            Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves. For example, 2023 marked one of the hottest years on record globally, with many regions experiencing unprecedented heatwaves and prolonged droughts.
            Species migration and biodiversity loss are increasingly linked to climate change. Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from "bleaching" due to rising ocean temperatures, which has led to significant losses in marine biodiversity.

            <h2>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h2><br>
           
           <p class="p">Burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2). These fuels are used extensively for electricity generation, transportation, industrial processes, and residential heating. <br>
               CO2 Emissions: When fossil fuels are burned, they release CO2 into the atmosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat from the sun and prevents it from escaping back into space. This leads to a gradual increase in the Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon known as global warming <br>Air Pollution: In addition to CO2, the burning of fossil fuels releases other harmful pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, leading to smog, respiratory issues, and other health problems..</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card"> <h2>Deforestation</h2><br>
           
            <p class="p"> Deforestation refers to the large-scale removal of trees and forests, often to make way for agriculture, urban development, or other human activities. This practice has significant environmental, social, and economic impacts.Forests are home to a large portion of the worldâ€™s biodiversity. Deforestation destroys habitats, leading to the extinction of many species.Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When they are cut down, the carbon stored in trees is released, contributing to global warming.Without trees to anchor the soil, deforested areas are prone to erosion, which can lead to landslides and loss of fertile land.Trees play a crucial role in maintaining the water cycle. Their removal can lead to reduced rainfall, drought, and disruption of local and global water systems.</p></div>
        <div class="card"> <h2>Melting of Glaciers</h2><br>
           
            <p class="p">Melting of Glaciers is a significant environmental issue that has garnered global attention due to its profound impact on ecosystems, sea levels, and human communities. Glaciers, massive bodies of dense ice that form over many years from compacted snow, are found primarily in polar regions and high mountain ranges. They are crucial components of the Earth's climate system, but they are increasingly threatened by rising global temperatures.One of the most significant consequences of glacier melting is the rise in sea levels. As glaciers melt, the water they contain flows into the oceans, contributing to rising sea levels. This poses a threat to coastal communities, as higher sea levels increase the risk of flooding, storm surges, and erosion.Many regions around the world rely on glaciers as a source of freshwater. </p></div>
        <div class="card"><h2>Industrial Activities</h2><br>
           
            <p class="p"> Industrial Activities are among the leading causes of global warming, contributing significantly to the rise in greenhouse gases and other pollutants in the Earth's atmosphere. The industrial sector includes a wide range of activities, from manufacturing and energy production to mining and chemical processing.The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity and heat is the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Power plants, industrial boilers, and residential heating systems release massive amounts of CO2, a key driver of global warming.The chemical industry, which produces plastics, fertilizers, and other products, releases a variety of greenhouse gases, including CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).  </p></div>
        <div class="card"> <h2>Transportation</h2><br>
           
            <p class="p">The transportation sector includes various modes, including road vehicles, aviation, maritime shipping, and rail, all of which rely heavily on fossil fuels. As a result, transportation is one of the leading sources of GHG emissions worldwide, playing a crucial role in the ongoing climate crisis.Cars, motorcycles, and light trucks are major sources of CO2 emissions due to their reliance on gasoline and diesel fuels. The combustion of these fuels releases large amounts of CO2, the most prevalent greenhouse gas. The global increase in vehicle ownership and the growing demand for personal mobility have led to a rise in emissions from this sector. NOx and VOCs contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, a key component of smog. Smog not only harms human health but also damages crops and ecosystems.</p></div>

            <h2>Rising Temperatures</h2><br>
           
            <p class="p"> Global warming leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves, which can cause heat-related illnesses and deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions.
                 Rising temperatures are causing glaciers and polar ice caps to melt at an accelerated rate, contributing to sea-level rise and the loss of critical habitats for species like polar bears and seals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card"> 
            <h2>Sea-Level Rise</h2><br>
           
           <p class="p">  As glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands due to higher temperatures, global sea levels rise. This leads to more frequent and severe coastal flooding, threatening low-lying areas and small island nations.
                Rising sea levels contribute to coastal erosion, leading to the loss of land and habitats. Mangroves, wetlands, and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, and their loss can reduce natural protection against storms and waves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card"> 
            <h2>Human Health Effects</h2><br>
           
            <p class="p"> Warmer temperatures can expand the range of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and Zika virus, as the insects that carry these diseases thrive in warmer climates.
                 Higher temperatures and increased air pollution, including ground-level ozone, can exacerbate respiratory problems like asthma and other lung diseases.</p>
